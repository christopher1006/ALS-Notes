# Financial Challenges
---

You may encounter a troop that is suffering financial difficulties.

They may be older, have more life experience, or more well educated. This cannot stop you from doing your job and making sure they get needed help.

Potential signs of trouble:
 - Seems to be spending beyond their means
  - Recently prchased a very expensive vehicle
  - Pays little attention to how much they're spending in social situations
  - Heavy spending 
  - Seemingly unaware that they are headed for financial disaster

Signs that the troop is already in trouble:
 - Change in mood
 - Anxious about even mundane money questions
 - Carefree about spending large amounts of money and seemingly unconcerned with future expenses.

Make sure to follow up with troops until the problem is actually resolved. Do not just pass them on to another agency and assume their issues are resolved.

Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and Military Lending Act provide special military protections.
