## MP 2 Verbal/Non-verbal Communication

- **Effective speaking**
    : To speak clearly and concisely, using F.O.C.U.S. This conveys a sense of credibility and imparts trust.

Failure to speak effectively can lead to miscommunication that is not caught and leads to the wrong result. It can also cause uncertainty about the capabilities of the individual.

Communicating sincerely and with care will show through.

Consider your audience when communicating. Being able to articulate ideas clearly is important. Make sure to understand local pronounciations, idioms, etc. so as not to hang up your audience.

- **Vocal Pause**
    : An unconcious use of a word, phrase, or sound used to maintain the speaking initiative but which adds nothing to a conversation.

Ensure tone/pitch is appropriate to the message. Be careful about how an accent may warp the apparant meaning.

Avoid cliche and overused idioms. Usage of these can hang up your audience and/or cause a degrading of perceived credibility.

Avoid colloquialisms, slang, as usage may increase personability but has a higher chance of reducing credibility and clarity.

- **Factual Speaking**
    : Base your message in facts that you have verified. Do not overextend into conjecture just to save face.

### Non-verbal cues to avoid.
- **Life Raft**
    : Hiding behind something during a speech to avoid exposure.

- **Caged Tiger**
    : Failing to contain nervous energy by constantly walking around without rhetorical intent.

- **Fidgeting**
    : Showing nervous energy in various ways such as hand wringing, meaningless hand movements, head bobbing, etc.

- **Ball and Chain**
    : Moving to and from the exact same spots repetitively.


## Effective Listening

- Use your eyes to follow the speaker. Be careful to avoid constant eye contact which may disturb them.

- Listen purely for the information involved. Don't just collect talking points to inject yourself at first chance.

- Listen versus hearing. Take in the information being conveyed by processing those sounds. Ensure you are focused on them to mitigate distractions.

Many different distractions can take from your ability to focus on the message:
 - Weather/Ambient conditions
 - Interesting events outside the window
 - Distracting sounds
 - Fatigue
 - Hunger
 - Personal electronics
