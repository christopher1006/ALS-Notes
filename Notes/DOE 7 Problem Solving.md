## MP 1 Basc steps of problem sovlving

- 1. **Define the problem** using practical thinking characteristics
- 2. Consider **possible solutions** to the problem intuitively.
- 3. **Weigh conseuqences** of COA logically.
- 4. **Weigh alternatives** susing socail sensitivity
- 5. **Compare** weighted solutions.
- 6. **Act** on the selected solution.
- 7. **Evaluate** the result and potentially return to previous parts of the list if the solution is not acceptable.

## MP 2 Characteristics Of A Good Problem Solvers

-   No need to be right all the time. Focus is on finding the solution rather than wanting to prove they are right.

-   Goes beyond a fixated mind set and open up to new ways of thinking.

-   Looks for opportunities to learn and overcome problems.

-   Knows when to consider the problem in a complex manner versus taking shortcuts to save time.

-   Operates with a clear definintion of what the problem is.

-   Socially well developed and will use the power of words to connect with people.

-   Does not create problems for others. While a solution may incorporate more people, it should not be made without long term considerations.

-   Strives to prevent more than commit to intervention. Ideally the issue is prevented before it has to be solved in motion.

-   Explores their options. Finds multiple, valid, solutions that could solve the problem in various ways.

-   Maintains reasonable expectations. By understanding their resources and situation, they are not affected by idealistic thoughts.

## MP 3 Styles And Techniques To Problem Solving

-   A general spectrum exists between innovation and adaption.

-   Innovative leaning individuals tend to lean towards independence and tearing down processes instead of modifying them.

-   Adaptive individuals are generally more team oriented and will go to solutions that fit better within existing regulations.

## MP 4 Problem Solving Performance Task

- Goal is to combine group members individual problem solving processes into a new process that represents and amalgamation of the group.

### Project restrictions
-   1. NCO level problem
-   2. Related to San Antonio/Lackland area
-   3. (ungraded) Presentation can be PowerPoint, story board, or anything else. Demonstrate:
    - iiia. How your group utilized different problem solving methods to create the new one and included a brief description of each step in the process.
    - iiib. Explain which problem your group selected in detail and how the new process was applied towards it.
    - The   student must create a product that meets the intent of step three. IF they do not create a product(visual aid) then they will receive a DNM.

- Each person needs to participate in the presentation in equal portions.

- Presentations **must** be 7 - 10 minutes. You will receive a verbal warning at 8 minutes.

- **At a minimum**, each student in a group has to identify their individual problem solving procesess.


- Technical difficulties count towards time.
